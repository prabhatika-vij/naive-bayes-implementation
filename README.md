# naive-bayes-implementation
Naive Bayes implemented from scratch in python. The algorithm is used to build a spam filter (using data from https://www.kaggle.com/odelali/spam-or-ham/data). Training data consists of 70% of the data and the rest 30% of the data is treated as test data. Accuracy, precision and recall are then displayed for each category (spam and ham) as output.
